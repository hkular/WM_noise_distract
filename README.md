Collection of working memory experiments testing effects of stimulus noise and various distractor conditions. Experiment names started out as detectives then switched to candy names for fun.

All experiment versions have base structure of oriented target followed by a delay with some type of distractor after which there is a full report task. Each version adds a different 
modification to test for different distractor effects. Differences between experiment versions briefly described here, for more details look at readme in each folder.

* Marlowe_V6_V7: first two versions after pilots 1-5, V6 long delay, V7 short delay
* Holmes_V8: arrhythmic fast distractor
* Cuff_V9: change detection distractor contrast
* Jellybean_V10: rectangle distractor wiggle
* Starburst_V11: cue color rectangle distractor
